The site of the latter is now the home of the Little Whispers Orphanage. Hollow Grove Sanitarium was founded in 1856 as a general wellness resort- a place for people with many different symptoms to come and alleviate their conditions. Over the years, the directors of the facility found more financial gain in converting the facility into an asylum, and charging rent to the state in exchange for easing the strained penitentiary system. This changed, for a time, in the late 1800’s after a concerted push for humanization of the mental health community, sparked by Nelly Bly’s expose, 10 Days in a Madhouse. Hollow Grove was updated with new electric lights and more modern treatment plans.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Narcissistic':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Narcissistic</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">Put on clothes that don't belong to you.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node24} alt='Narcissistic' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        “Mon Dieu, mec, tu ne sais pas épeler ?

The site of the former has now been turned into a WWI museum. Hollow Grove Sanatorium was founded in 1863 by Christian missionaries as a center for the treatment of respiratory diseases like tuberculosis (the name was a mistranslated attempt at “Hallowed Grounds”). With the coming of the Great War, the facility was quickly co-opted as a war hospital due to its proximity to the Western Front. A great many wounded soldiers passed through its doors, and few survived, either due to the nature of their wounds, or the inept or malicious nature of the staff. Because of the strain of medical facilities throughout Europe during this time, Hollow Grove also doubled as an asylum, taking in those who could not handle the mental stresses of the war. There are no records remaining of the poor souls committed to Hollow Grove, however, almost as though someone or something did not want their existence known. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Co-ordinated':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Co-ordinated</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">Impressed Hamlin with your dancing skills.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node25} alt='Co-ordinated' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        “You see, sometimes… things get worse.

Of specific concern are the effects of creating a paradox. There are some who believe that a causal loop, or “bootstrap paradox”, (wherein a time traveler going into the past to change events ends up creating the very events he traveled back to change) would create a logical inconsistency that could break the fabric of time. Others believe that a bootstrap paradox is the only form of paradox that could be allowed by the laws of physics to exist; it is instead the “Grandfather Paradox”, (named for the hypothetical time traveler who goes back in time and kills his own grandfather, thus preventing his birth and subsequent parricide) that threatens space-time with a logical fallacy powerful enough to tear it apart. Of course, these models disregard the possibility of multiple timelines and realities created by individual choices. Ultimately, this debate may never be settled, given its purely speculative nature. After all, time travel and branching realities are things of pure fiction impossible for any one person to truly observe, aren’t they?\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Arrogant':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Arrogant</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">This still isn't a Marvel movie...</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node28} alt='Arrogant' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        \"I have never seen water damage do anything like this.

He began to formulate a theory about altered states of consciousness and their effects on a Divinator’s ability to see the future- but that was a thesis that, unfortunately, had no future.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Insubordinate':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Insubordinate</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">You refused to do as you were told.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node36} alt='Insubordinate' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <p>\n                        In the 1750’s a member of the Order put forth a theory: it was possible, he said, to replicate the process of creating a Pandora stone in an unorthodox method. Instead of utilizing an alchemically infused container, he suggested using a human heart as a vessel. What better container on earth to hold blood than the one nature designed? Of course, the cost of creating such a stone would be a human life, a proposition the Elders of the Order did not agree with.

The cult gained popularity over the next twenty to thirty years, but its true purpose was known to only a few: Glycon was a fabrication of Alexander, and the real subject of their worship was the Mesopotamian demoness, Lamashtu.<br/>\n                        Soon after the Cult’s founding, Alexander learned of the existence of a large, three sided Obelisk, hidden inside the Library of Alexandria and powerful enough, he believed, to return Lamashtu to our world. Though Alexander died before his task could be completed, his followers managed to steal Obelisk and bring it to the city of Chalcedon, where they undertook a dangerous ritual. They would have succeeded, had it not been for the intervention of the Order of the Three Keys. Instead of banishing her again, they had no choice but to seal her inside the Obelisk, and keep her contained with alchemically-imbued chains. They then tossed the Obelisk into the Black Sea, hoping to keep Lamastu hidden from the world forever. They would henceforth be known as the Order of the Three Keys.<br/><br/>\n\n                        But the demoness had other ideas. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'LikeINeedAHoleInTheHead':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <iframe \n                        width=\"560\" \n                        height=\"315\" \n                        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_X5ji2HGmU?&autoplay=1\" \n                        title=\"YouTube video player\" \n                        frameborder=\"0\" \n                        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n                        allowfullscreen\n                    />\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Dishonest':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Dishonest</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">Revealed \"Tidwell\"'s true nature.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node52} alt='Dishonest' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        “A week ago our hunters were able to track down the Proctor serving as Lamashtu’s host body.

However their traveling companion, a man known to history as the Comte de St. Germain, was an exceptionally talented alchemist, and in possession of something of incredible value: a map to the underwater location of the forgotten Obelisk. It was, therefore, extremely unfortunate that their caravan should be set upon by a raiding party belonging to the Khan of the Golden Horde, Jani Beg.<br/>\n                        Stedelin and Kolgrim were middling at pain tolerance, as well, and it did not take long before the Khan’s torturer forced them to confess the map’s importance. Obsessed with what he saw as the ultimate weapon, Jani Beg raided the port city of Kaffi, stole two boats, and had his men dredge up the Obelisk from its resting place of over a thousand years. <br/>\n                        St. Germain managed to escape into the night while the Khan’s attention was divided, but the ritual to break the Chains of Chalcedon was simple, even for two middling Theurgists. Lamashtu soon walked the world again after two millenia, and seeing the rise of corruption and feudalism across Europe, decided that a cleansing was in order.

The Order of the Three Keys had long since scattered, weakened by the Great Dissolution of 363 AD and hadn’t attempted to centralize their power since. The organization only existed in small clusters, very few evening knowing of the other’s existence. St. Germain traveled throughout the world, attempting to rejoin the broken pieces of the Order, and finally crossed paths with a man by the name of Nicholas Flamel. <br/>\n                        Flamel was not a member of the Order, but was still a supremely talented alchemist, with skill that put even St. Germain to shame. He also had connections all over Europe. Within months, he had managed to put together a group of Hermeticists strong enough to stand up to Lamashtu.<br/>\n                        The banishment ritual was grueling, and more than a few lost their lives in the struggle, but by the end, the demoness found herself bound within the Obelisk once again, and a divinator named Jacobina Felice was charged with hiding the the Obelisk where no one else could find it.<br/>\n                        Saddened by his role in Lamashtu’s release, St. Germain lamented there was not time enough to make up for his mistakes. Hearing this, Flamel produced a vial of red liquid, and insisted St. Germain take a single sip, then remarked that perhaps he could find the time after all. Flamel left, never crossing paths with the Order again.<br/>\n                        Historical accounts state that a man called the Comte de St. Germain died in 1784. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'TheManyMadeOne':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <iframe \n                        width=\"560\" \n                        height=\"315\" \n                        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDrgD-SYacw?&autoplay=1\" \n                        title=\"YouTube video player\" \n                        frameborder=\"0\" \n                        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n                        allowfullscreen\n                    />\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Uneasy':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Uneasy</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">Brokered an alliance with \"Tidwell\".</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node56} alt='Uneasy' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        “Daughter Vepar- <br/>\n                        Know, first, that the idea of writing this letter fills me with loathing.

However, in her final months, she was racked with doubts- what if this artefact was needed by her Order in the future? Her visions had failed years ago, and she was no longer sure of her predictions. In a fit of weakness, she left clues that, if followed, would lead back to the Obelisk’s hiding place.<br/><br/>\n\n                        Unfortunately for Felice, it was the Children of the Broken Chain that would find those clues. But by the time they located the Obelisk, it lay buried under a bustling city, and excavating Sevastopol was not something done in secret. So the Children began whispering in the ears of the right people, stoking conflict, fanning the flames until the world heard the opening salvos of the Crimean War.<br/><br/>\n\n                        The chaos of the siege of Sevastopol served as a perfect cover to enter the city, find the Obelisk, and remove it without being noticed. The naval bombardments and trench digging did have the excavation for them, and the ill-fated and infamous Charge of the Light Brigade (itself a credit to the string-pulling abilities of the Children) ensured that there were no English troops around to witness the Obelisk being pulled from the Earth.<br/><br/>\n\n                        The only problem, of course, was that the Children had long lost the knowledge of how to release Lamashtu from the Obelisk again. But perhaps they could trick someone else into unwittingly doing it for them. Someone willing to direct vast amounts of power and arcane energies into the Obelisk… someone desperate, with nothing left to lose…\n                    </p>\n\n                </div>\n            )\n        break;\n        case 'Opportunistic':\n            nodeContent = (\n                <div>\n                    <h1 className=\"my-4 text-4xl font-archaic\">Opportunistic</h1>\n                    <p className=\"text-lg\">Did not release your fellow inmates before making your choice.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <img src={node57} alt='Opportunistic' loading='lazy' />\n                    <br />\n                    <blockquote>\n                        “She who sees beyond the curves of time.

The world is on a collision course with disaster, and only something with extreme power can divert its trajectory. <br/><br/>\n\n                        Throughout history, cults connected to Lamashtu have written of a coming calamity, one that could swallow up the world, and of Lamashtu’s singular ability to prevent it. Her followers believe all her terrible acts are a necessary evil, clearing the bad seeds of humanity before they have a chance to manifest their chaos. And there are some who believe this calamity has already begun.<br/><br/>\n\n                        But every writing is frustratingly vague about the nature of this disaster- is it something mundane as a force of nature? Something extrasolar? Or something even bigger? Is existence itself at risk?
